title: "Flutter Test"
summary: |-
  Performs any test in a Flutter project.

description: |-

  If you have tests in your repository, and selected `yes` when prompted during app creation, the primary Workflow will include the **Flutter Test** Step by default. 
  If you add tests to your app later, add the **Flutter Test** Step to your Workflow manually. The Step runs the `flutter test` command with the specified flags. To check the available flags, open a command line interface on your own machine and run `flutter test --help`.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Provide your project's root directory in the **Project Location** field.
  2. The **Step's test result directory** is the root directory for all test results created by the Bitrise CLI. This input gets filled out automatically.
  3. You can append additional flags to the default `flutter test` command in the **Additional parameters** field.
  4. Select 'yes' in the **Generate code coverage files** input to get detailed analysis of your code.


  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure the **Project Location** input of the Flutter Test Step is correct. 
  The default value is the Environment Variable (Env Var) created for your Flutter projectâ€™s location.
